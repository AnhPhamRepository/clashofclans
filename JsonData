They are also the cheapest and one of the most common defensive structure available, which makes them a good initial investment.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Cannons are one of the few defensive structures that cannot attack air units. This makes them easy pickings for Beta Minions or Baby Dragons if they are not within range of Firecrackers, Archer Towers, Hidden Teslas, or Air Bombs.\n   The Beta Minions' Long Shot ability allows them to destroy a Cannon while out of range if there are enough and placed correctly.\n   Cannons are only able to damage one unit at a time.

This requires Cannon at least level 7 in the Home Village and a level 4 Double Cannon in the Builder Base.\n   While Double Cannons do high damage per second, they have a short range and cannot attack air troops.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   Double Cannons can destroy most ground troops of relative level in one burst, namely Raged Barbarians, Sneaky Archers, Bombers, Cannon Carts and Night Witches. This makes Double Cannons useful to pick off smaller troops when they are in small numbers.\n   Double Cannons are very powerful defenses against ground tanks such as the Boxer Giant or the Battle Machine. A few volleys can do significant damage to them.\n   Their short range prevents them from protecting buildings in front of them from Sneaky Archers if a Wall separates the Double Cannon and the building. It may still be useful to leave a building in front of them to prevent Sneaky Archers from easily destroying them under their cloak.\n   Although it has high damage output, the Double Cannon has a weakness against large swarms, as their burst only targets one unit. You will find it useful to protect Double Cannons with splash-damaging defenses like the Multi Mortar or the Roaster. Its inability to attack air also means that you should also protect Double Cannons with air-targeting defenses like Archer Towers.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Air troops such as the Baby Dragon have little to worry from a Double Cannon since the Double Cannon cannot attack them. However, the Double Cannon can still distract them and prevent them from attacking more important buildings.\n   The Double Cannon is weak against large swarms.

      "desc": "- Summary:\n   The Archer Tower is a defensive building that can target both air and ground units. This building is unlocked at Builder Hall level 2. Like the Home Village Archer Tower, it is a single-target defense.\n   The Archer Tower can be set to Long Range or Fast Attack. Both modes has its advantages and disadvantages.\n     The Long Range mode gives the Archer Tower a range of eleven tiles, at the cost of DPS. It has the lowest DPS of any single-target defensive building at relative level in this mode.\n     The Fast Attack mode gives the Archer Tower additional damage output by firing twice as fast as the Long Range mode. This comes at the cost of range - even as its range is reduced by four tiles, it covers only about 40% of the area that a Long Range Archer Tower would cover.\n     When upgrading, an Archer Tower's damage per second increase of Fast Attack is twice as much as the damage per second increase of Long Range so Fast Attack is always twice the DPS of Long Range.\n   The Master Builder can go to your Home Village and gear up an Archer Tower that is level 10 or above in order to allow it to toggle between Long Range and Fast Attack modes. This requires a level 6 Archer Tower in the Builder Base. Like with other gear ups, only one Archer Tower can be geared up.\n   The Archer Tower in fast fire mode in the Builder Base has the same attack speed as a normal Archer Tower in the Home Village.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   An Archer Tower set to Long Range can protect outer buildings from Sneaky Archers and Beta Minions. However, the Sneaky Archer's Cloak ability allows it to hide for a few seconds, and the Archer Tower can do nothing to stop the Sneaky Archers under their cloak.\n   An Archer Tower that is set to Fast Attack cannot protect buildings in front of it. However, it is more effective at taking down tank-units, and they are more able to handle small swarms of Bats or Skeletons in this manner.\n   You can protect Archer Towers with splash damaging defenses like the Crusher since it is a single-target defense.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Try to swarm the Archer Tower with swarm units such as Raged Barbarians as it is single-target.\n   Use tanks like Boxer Giants to distract it so that supported troops can take down outer buildings.\n   Long-range Archer Towers have fairly low damage output, taking three shots to kill equivalently-leveled Sneaky Archers or Beta Minions. If you use Sneaky Archers or Beta Minions to snipe buildings and there are no more unprotected buildings, choosing buildings protected only by a single long-range Archer Tower will give your troops the most time to attack before they are destroyed.",

It is unlocked at Builder Hall level 3.\n   Before it begins attacking, the Hidden Tesla remains completely hidden to the attacker. Once a unit is within 6 tiles of the Tesla, the Tesla emerges from the ground and begins attacking. Like its Home Village counterpart, it automatically emerges from the ground if it's still hidden when at least 51% of the base is destroyed.\n   It attacks enemies with electricity, just like its Home Village counterpart. It has the same fire rate and range, however, its damage compared to equivalently leveled Hidden Teslas in the Home Village is higher at low levels but lower at high levels.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Enemies need a 2x2 clear space for a Hidden Tesla, evaluate the worst place for a Tesla placement and deploy accordingly.\n   Sneaky Archers can show you the location of a Hidden Tesla, even when invisible. Placing one Sneaky Archer of the relative level or will be able to take down the Hidden Tesla.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   The Hidden Tesla can be used to lure your opponent into an air attack, then take out the air units. This is very effective at Builder Hall level three as they only have Beta Minions; when your opponent destroys your Firecrackers and Archer Tower, he/she will send in his/her Beta Minions only to get destroyed by your Hidden Tesla.\n   You can place a Hidden Tesla at the corner of a base (far away from everything else on the base) as a tactic to stall enemy attacks. If the enemy deploys their full army before achieving 51% (or otherwise revealing the Tesla), they will not have anything to immediately deal with the corner Tesla, which can stall out their attack should they destroy all other buildings on the base. Provided that you are able to 3-star their base, this can potentially allow you to achieve victory on the time tiebreaker.",

The Air Bombs do high, area damage in a small range while the Firecrackers snipe away at long range.\n   At Builder Hall level 3, Firecrackers are an essential defense against Beta Minions as the Archer Tower and Hidden Tesla can both be distracted by ground units.",

Troops prefer to target buildings over Walls so they will run through the gap.\n   You can put a Guard Post near a Crusher so the Guard Post troops will lure your opponent's troops into the Crusher.\n   Protect short-ranged defenses such as the Double Cannon and the Mega Tesla behind the Crusher as ground troops will have to go through the Crusher to destroy it.\n   Try to avoid putting Crushers by Walls as they cannot crush troops over them, allowing the ranged units more time to destroy the Crusher.\n   Try to put Crushers near your Firecrackers and Air Bombs to protect them from the Skeletons of the Drop Ship. Since they tend to have a tough time taking the Crusher out, it will stall the Drop Ships, giving your Firecrackers and Air Bombs ample time to take it out.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   The Boxer Giant's Power Punch ability can destroy a Crusher if there are enough Giants at once.\n   Use air troops to take down the Crusher if using a swarm attack. This is only for unprotected Crushers - watch out for Firecrackers, Air Bombs, and the Archer from the Guard Post!\n   To avoid a luring technique, as explained above, use Bombers to destroy Walls and create another opening into a base away from the Crusher.\n   The Battle Machine can take out the Crusher before it does massive damage to units, especially with the ability, Electric Hammer. However, with the help of other defenses, the Battle Machine will likely be at low hitpoints or taken out by the Crusher.\n   You can take advantage of the Crusher's long cooldown time between slams by baiting it with a few Raged Barbarians then swarming it with more Raged Barbarians to take it down before it has a chance to crush the rest of the Raged Barbarians again.

Extra Raged Barbarians or Sneaky Archers may be added with a new level.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Troops that don't have a preferred target will turn to target Guard Post troops even while attacking another building.\n   You can use air units such as Baby Dragons to take out the Raged Barbarian(s) from the Guard Post as they can't target air.\n   The Bomber's splash damage allows them to destroy any Guard Post troops with a few shots along with other buildings and Walls.\n     Their ability, which allows them to do extra damage on the first throw, allows them to one-shot the troops.\n   When using Sneaky Archers, make sure you destroy the Guard Post troops or attack from far off as the Sneaky Archers will not distract the Guard Post troops and follow them instead while they are still in their cloaks.\n     Raged Barbarians are excellent at finishing off Guard Post troops as they are expendable units that are fast and can attract Guard Post troops.\n   Beta Minions can kill off Guard Post troops well given their Long Shot ability, which protects them from both defences and the Guard Post troops for a short while.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   The Guard Post can be placed near defensive buildings to distract enemies, giving defenses more time for damage. They can also snipe away at building-targeting troops like the Boxer Giant.\n   The Guard Post can protect outer buildings that are out of range of other defensive buildings.\n   You can use the Guard Post to tank the Power Punch of the Boxer Giant(s) as the building itself serves no purpose on defense.\n   Since most troops will attack the Guard Post troops if attacked by them, you can strategically use the Guard Post troops to lure them into the range of powerful defenses like the Crusher.",

This is only true if the Air Bombs are close to the outer edge of your opponent's base or you will have to spend a lot of troops to take out a few buildings.\n   Try to avoid the Air Bombs when attacking your opponents using air, as it only has an 8 tile range and cannot shoot at the whole map.\n   You can spread out your troops so it can only hit one at a time. This is doubly useful with an all-Baby Dragon attack since they will also benefit from their ability (if you have it unlocked).\n   The Drop Ship can tank multiple hits from the Air Bombs, allowing air units with lower hitpoints to destroy other buildings.\n   Make it a priority to destroy Air Bombs to give way for your other air troops.

To do so, the Multi Mortar needs to be level 8 in the Builder Base.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   Place the Multi Mortar at the center of the base to cover as much area as possible and to slow troops from getting too close to it.\n     You can use the Multi Mortar's inability to hit nearby units to your advantage, as the Multi Mortar will target support units, such as the Sneaky Archers, Cannon Carts, and Night Witches following behind the tanks and take care of them so they don't do too much damage.\n   The Multi Mortar's splash damaging shells makes it good at taking down hordes of low-hitpoint troops but can be easily distracted by high-hitpoint troops. In particular, they work very well against Sneaky Archers and Skeletons dropped by the Drop Ship, but can also deal good damage to Raged Barbarians, Night Witches and Cannon Carts.\n   Because of its inability to hit nearby troops, it can be good to place the Crusher near it as it is another area damage defense that deals high damage. However, the Crusher cannot fully cover the blind spot of the Multi Mortar due to its extremely short range. In addition, neither can attack air troops, so that should also be kept in mind when building a layout.\n   The Multi Mortar can stop Bombers from doing too much damage to your base. At relative level, where the Bomber is twice or less than the level of the Multi Mortar, a volley of 4 shots can destroy a Bomber.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Air units are a good option, as the Multi Mortar cannot hit them.\n     Drop Ships cannot be attacked by the Multi Mortar, but its Skeletons can be easily wiped out by it, unless they get too close.\n     Use tanks such as Boxer Giants or the Battle Machine to distract the Multi Mortar while you swarm the base. Take care that they do not all enter the Multi Mortar's blind spot, otherwise, it will retarget.\n   Try to get near it as it cannot hit troops close to it.\n   Try to spread out your troops so the Multi Mortar cannot hit all of them at once.",

      "desc": "- Summary:\n   The Mega Tesla is a defensive building in the Builder Base that unlocks at Builder Hall level 8.\n   It is a defense that can damage both air and ground troops.\n   The Mega Tesla attacks with chain lightning; the electricity it fires damages a first target within the range of the Tesla, and then, if possible, the bolt will arc towards a second target up to 3 tiles away from the first target and hit for full damage.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   The Mega Tesla deals high damage, but has a low fire rate and can only hit up to two targets per attack. It is therefore most specialised at attacking troops that are relatively low in numbers, such as Baby Dragons, Cannon Carts and Hog Gliders, while troops that have strength in numbers or can swarm the Mega Tesla with its spawns, such as Raged Barbarians or Night Witches, will have less trouble with the Mega Tesla.\n   Because of the aforementioned weakness against swarms, it is good to protect the Mega Tesla using splash-damaging defenses and traps, such as the Roaster, Crusher, and Mega Mines, to prevent enemies from distracting it with lower-hitpoint troops.\n   Among defenses of equal level, the Mega Tesla does the second-most damage of any defense in the Builder Base, behind the Crusher. However, the Mega Tesla has advantages over the Crusher in that it can target air troops (and ranged troops in most scenarios) at the cost of AOE, where Crusher has an advantage.\n   The Mega Tesla's Chain Lightning is able to target hidden Sneaky Archers but only if it somehow attacks an enemy that is too close to the archer.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Mega Tesla is extremely weak against swarms, so Raged Barbarians can have an advantage since they would only be able to take out two at a time.\n   Drop Ships can tank several shots from the Mega Tesla and drop Skeletons to distract it and potentially deal damage (though minor).",

      "name": "Lava Launcher",
      "desc": "- Summary:\n   The Lava Launcher is a defensive building that is unlocked at Builder Hall level 9.\n   It throws powerful balls of lava that do a small amount of damage on impact, but leaves the ground scorched, which has a damage-over-time effect (similar to the Poison Spell) on ground troops. The effect of the lava remains for 20 seconds after impact.\n   It has a very large range, but also a very large blind spot as well.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Using air troops is advantageous, as the Lava Launcher cannot attack air units. For this purpose, Baby Dragons or Drop Ships paired with Beta Minions work very well, though in the case of Drop Ships, their Skeletons' effect may be nullified by the Lava Launcher.\n   If your only option of attacking is by ground then the best way to proceed would be to distract the Lava Launcher with expendable units such as a single Raged Barbarian, and ensure it fires away from the line of attack until the main attacking force has safely entered the Lava Launcher's blind spot. If done correctly the lava will not impede the attack's progress.\n   Super P.E.K.K.As are also useful as their very high health means that they can survive for much longer in the lava compared to other troops.\n   The Battle Machine is largely immune to the damage over time effect (like how Heroes are minimally affected by Poison Spells), so having the Battle Machine be targeted will minimize the DPS of the Lava Launcher.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   Often it is not the damage of the lava shot itself that is devastating, but rather the massive DPS from the damage over time effect of the resulting lava. If allowed to reach maximum DPS the lava can easily make short work of many smaller troops, such as Raged Barbarians, Sneaky Archers, Cannon Carts, and Night Witches. To increase the chances of this happening it is often advantageous to stall attacking troops behind Walls so that they will stay in the lava for as long as possible, racking up damage, but make sure that the Walls can cover the Lava Launcher's blind spot.\n     It is also useful to protect these Walls as Bombers can easily clear them, allowing for other troops to rush into the blind spot.\n   The biggest weakness of the Lava Launcher is its blind spot. Cover it with other defenses to protect it and try to use traps to keep troops in the range of the Launcher.",

These segments cannot be separated but can be rotated. When upgraded, all the Walls in the same segment will be upgraded at the same time.\n     This is true when counting Walls. When you unlock new Walls, it may say that you unlocked 25 Walls, but there are only 5 more wall segments.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Walls can be circumvented by destroying them or positioning ranged troops to shoot over the Walls. Walls can be bypassed completely by air units such as Beta Minions.\n     Melee units will only attack Walls if there are no other buildings near them and if there is a building on the other side of the Wall.\n     Ranged units will only attack Walls if there are no other buildings in their sight ranges other than those across the Wall that is (almost) completely surrounded by Walls and that are outside its attack range.\n   The Bomber has a 15x damage multiplier against walls.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   Purposely create gaps in Walls to put a trap in as the enemy troops will walk into the gap instead of breaking the Wall.\n     You can also do this by putting a Crusher in the gap.\n   Use Walls to surround defenses to protect them. Try to surround structures that assist in defense so they do not get taken out easily.\n   It is unnecessary to protect resource buildings with Walls since they are used to absorb damage, and it is not possible to lose resources from versus battles. Protecting them, however, can still force the opponent to break through them and stall their progress.\n   Do not place 3x3 buildings too close to the Walls. If a Bomber is protected and manages to target it, the Walls will be shattered easily. This is especially dangerous if the Bomber is at level 11 since its ability can destroy Walls at any level.",

They can greatly improve the effectiveness of a village's defense if properly placed.\n   Traps do not light up the map like other buildings.\n   Traps are always ready for the next battle and do not need to be re-armed, unlike the ones in the Home Village.\n   Although commonly thought of as a trap, the Hidden Tesla is not listed here as it actually a hidden Defensive Building.\n   Traps are not buildings and do not need to be triggered/destroyed for your enemy to reach 100% destruction (nor do they count toward it).\n   Traps do not need the Master Builder to be available in order to be placed, however, the Master Builder needs to be available to upgrade them.\n   Traps are best used to push enemies off the base or just push them, or just to reduce the enemies health.\n   The Mine and Mega Mine can be set to hit ground or air troops.\n - Upgrade Facts:\n   Currently, all permanent traps have upgrade levels.\n   You can upgrade a trap once it is bought from the Shop. Buying the trap does not require the Master Builder; however, upgrading will.\n   Upgrade times are relatively short compared to defensive building upgrades, taking less time than defensive buildings of similar level.\n   Upgrade times are relatively short compared to defensive building upgrades, taking less time than defensive buildings of similar level.\n   Traps have different upgrade types, with some traps increasing their affected housing space like the Push Trap while others dealing more damage, like the Mine.\n   Traps being upgraded are visible to enemies; it is usually a good idea to relocate them while they are being upgraded to ensure that enemies don't know where traps aren't. However, remember to replace them when it is finished upgrading.\n   Each trap must be upgraded individually. Upgrading one trap does not upgrade all traps of that type.\n   Traps have no effect on the no-spawn zone. Attackers can deploy troops on top of traps regardless of whether or not they are being upgraded.\n - Using Traps:\n   Traps in the Builder Base do not require re-arming, unlike those in the Home Village.

      "desc": "- Summary:\n    The Builder Hall is the equivalent of the Town Hall in the Builder Base. Protection of the Builder Hall is critical for preventing players from getting one star on your base in an attack.\n    Upgrading the Builder Hall will unlock more buildings.\n    The level 1 Builder Hall is broken, and has graves, along with several broken Buildings surrounding it when it is first encountered in the tutorial. These include a Star Laboratory, Gem Mine, Clock Tower, Battle Machine, Elixir Collector, Gold Mine, Cannon, Army Camp, and Builder Barracks.\n    During the tutorial, the Builder Hall is upgraded to level 2, and in doing so buildings immediately surrounding it are automatically repaired. In addition to this, the Boat is also repaired and the Raged Barbarians are upgraded to level 2.\n    There are a total of 9 levels for Builder Hall.\n    You must place all buildings available from the current Builder Hall level before you are able to upgrade the Builder Hall.\n      Exceptions to this rule are the Gem Mine, Clock Tower and Battle Machine, for which repairing is optional.\n    The Builder Hall can be accessed once a player reaches Town Hall 4 in your Home Village by repairing the broken boat on the sea shore.\n - Strategy and Tips:\n    The Builder Hall is best placed in the center protected by buildings as it gives a star to your opponent when destroyed. This is critical as the star is compared first before the damage percentage, and if your opponent can get to the Builder Hall, he/she will most likely get more than 50% given them a 2-star or maybe even a 3-star.\n    Don't place your Builder Hall in a corner surrounded by Walls, troops can still be placed next to the Builder Hall.\n    The Crusher is extremely good at protecting the Builder Hall because of its high damage in a small radius. Make sure to protect it using defenses with a longer range to prevent ranged troops to snipe away at them.\n    Unlike the Town Hall in the Home Village, it can be beneficial to rush (quickly upgrade) the Builder Hall, as loot penalty does not exist - loot won is determined solely by the number of Versus Trophies that you have. Additionally, at higher Builder Hall levels you can unlock new buildings and troops as well as new levels for existing troops and buildings. Indeed, it can also be beneficial to rush the Builder Hall to unlock O.T.T.O as quickly as possible, thus enabling the Master Builder to be used as an extra builder in the Home Village.",

One can estimate the amount of resources in the mine by looking at the cart at the right side of the mine.\n    The Gold Mine takes up a 3x3 space.\n    When you choose to upgrade a Gold Mine, it will automatically collect any uncollected Builder Gold. Note that if your Gold Storage are full at that time, the uncollected Builder Gold will be lost! During the upgrade, the Mine stops producing Builder Gold.\n    Unlike the Gold Mine in the Home Village, the Builder Gold produced by the Gold Mine in the Builder Base isn't at risk even if it is destroyed.\n    At each level, the production per hour and its Builder Gold capacity are such that the Gold Mine always fills in 24 hours.

There is also a very small stone rubble pile on the edge of the structure.\n      At level 3, a third wooden reinforcing bar is added, and the rubble pile outside the structure grows to a noticeable size.\n      At level 4, a fourth wooden reinforcing bar is added, and the rubble pile outside the structure grows larger as well.\n      At level 5, the first major graphical change takes place. The wooden reinforcing bars are replaced with a blue-gray steel bar, and the rubble pile outside the Mine is replaced by a stone support.\n      At level 6, a thin brown thread is added to the back of the Mine.\n      At level 7, the steel reinforcing bar appears to be larger in width. Another wooden bar is also added to the back.\n      At level 8, the Gold Mine now has two wide steel reinforcing bars bolted down, and a small pulley system, complete with a wooden track for the cable, appears on the top surface of the Mine.\n      At level 9, additional pulley hardware is added to the top of the structure, and the pulley wheel itself grows larger.",

It requires Builder Hall 3 to be repaired.\n    When in disrepair, the Gem Mine is treated similarly to an obstacle (much like the ruined Clan Castle) and cannot be moved around; attacking troops will not be able to attack or destroy it (nor do they need to do so in order to achieve 100% destruction). Once rebuilt, it can be moved freely around.\n      However, troops cannot be deployed on top of it.\n    The Gem Mine, as its name suggests, produces Gems, albeit very slowly. These mined Gems are then stored until the player collects them or the storage fills.\n    Like other resource-producing buildings in both villages, upgrading the Gem Mine will disable production for the duration of the upgrade.\n - Upgrade Differences:\n    Gem Mines undergo a significant visual change at levels 1, 3, 7, 8 and 9.\n      In its initial ruined state, it appears as a derelict, overgrown cave. A Gem insignia on a wooden hexagon on the side of the rocks can be found on the Mine's side. There are large broken wooden planks covering the entrance and a broken box. There are also Gems scattered around the Mine.\n      When reconstructed, the Gem Mine is a cave-like structure with a wooden arch supported by ropes at the entrance. The Gem insignia is present on the side of the Mine, and a rail conveyor extends out of the cave, into a box containing Gems. Outside the cave is a torch.\n      At level 2, the Gem Mine's arch and base are reinforced by metal. The grass on the side of the Gem Mine has disappeared.\n      At level 3, the top of the cave is replaced by an open roof and a pulley system. More wooden planks are added to the sides of the opened roof, in order to support the pulley. Additional reinforcing metal plates appear at the top of the entrance.\n      At level 4, the reinforcing metal plates change to a bronze-colored scheme. A second pulley is also added.\n      At level 5, the reinforcing wooden structure now extends to the back of the cave, and additional bronze plates are added to the backside of the roof.\n      At level 6, the pulley system becomes bronze, with wood covering the roof.\n      At level 7, a bar is fixed to the roof, and it now suspends the pulley system. Ropes can be seen between the two pulleys, and the roof now appears to be made of stone. The Gem Mine receives a stone base with more support.\n      At level 8, the wooden supports at the corners are replaced with larger wooden beams. The beams are slanted and support a new pulley system consisting of one large pulley with its bar attached to the roof by bolts.\n      At level 9, the bases of the supports at the corners have been replaced with iron bases, and the pulley system on top has been replaced with a larger one.",

      "desc": "- Summary:\n    The O.T.T.O Hut is a building unlocked at Builder Hall level 9.\n    The O.T.T.O Hut does nothing when initially built, and will only serve as a distraction defensive-wise then. However, it houses the O.T.T.O which can only become active when the O.T.T.O Hut is upgraded to level 5.\n    Upgrading the O.T.T.O Hut does not take time or resources, but instead, a certain prerequisite must be completed (and the Master Builder must also be available to upgrade the building). To upgrade the O.T.T.O Hut to level 5, four such prerequisites must be satisfied.\n      To upgrade to level 2, you need to gear up a Cannon, Archer Tower and a Mortar in the Home Village. This requires a level 7 Cannon, a level 10 Archer Tower and a level 8 Mortar respectively in the Home Village, and a level 4 Cannon, a level 6 Archer Tower, and a level 8 Multi Mortar in the Builder Base.\n      To upgrade to level 2, you need to gear up a Cannon, Archer Tower and a Mortar in the Home Village. This requires a level 7 Cannon, a level 10 Archer Tower and a level 8 Mortar respectively in the Home Village, and a level 4 Cannon, a level 6 Archer Tower, and a level 8 Multi Mortar in the Builder Base.\n      To upgrade to level 3, you need to upgrade the Cannon Cart to level 18 (which requires Star Laboratory level 9).\n      To upgrade to level 4, you need to upgrade the Mega Tesla to level 9.\n      To upgrade to level 5, you need to upgrade the Battle Machine to level 30.\n    Once the O.T.T.O Hut is upgraded to level 5, O.T.T.O is activated and functions as an additional builder in the Builder Base. The Master Builder can then freely travel between the Home Village and Builder Base as the player so chooses, whenever he is not working on a building and can function as an extra Builder in either base as long as you have the Master Builder's Hut built in the Home Village.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n    Try to take out the O.T.T.O Hut with a single small unit, such as a Sneaky Archer, for extra percentage in an attack.\n - Trivia:\n    Since the level 2 O.T.T.O Hut requires gearing up all 3 buildings currently available to be geared up, the upgrade effectively requires players to have Town Hall level 10 or above, since the Mortar gear up requires the Mortar to be level 8 (which requires TH10).\n    The O.T.T.O Hut has the same amount of hitpoints and Build Time as a Builder's Hut from the Home Village.\n    A question was posted on the Supercell forum about what O.T.T.O stand for and Darian the Supercell community manager replied with Organizatonal [sic] Tidying Trimmer Organizer, Orbital Tedium Tending Orderly, and Outstanding Tolerable Tributary Oscillator. The post can be found\n    The O.T.T.O Hut is the only building that requires other buildings to be upgraded to a certain level or modified to be upgraded, unlike all the other buildings, which take time and cost resources.\n    The O.T.T.O Hut and the Battle Machine Altar are the buildings in Builder Base that have the least amount of hitpoints.\n    The O.T.T.O Hut is the only building In Builder Base to have the fewest levels, which is 5.\n    The O.T.T.O Hut is the second extra Builder Hut that doesn’t cost gems (the other is the Master Builder's Hut on the main Home Village).",

      "desc": "- Summary:\n    The Builder Barracks is a building that is unlocked at Builder Hall level 2.\n    The Builder Barracks trains Builder Base Troops. The player can have only one copy of the building.\n      Troops don't take any time or resources to train. Trained troops can be freely changed before the start of a Versus Battle.\n      Upgrading it doesn't interfere with its functionality.\n    The troops trained by the Builder Barracks are stored in the Army Camps.\n      The Builder Barracks is still able to train troops even when being upgraded, unlike Barracks in the Home Village.\n    Builder Base Troops exhibit special abilities that manifest when sufficiently upgraded; these abilities are unlocked when upgraded to level 2, except for the Night Witch, who unlocks her ability at level 4. These abilities usually power them up temporarily after being deployed, or activates when they are destroyed.\n - Upgrade Differences:\n    The Builder Barracks undergoes significant visual changes at every level.\n    At level 1, the Builder Barracks is a square building with a sloped red roof and two crossed swords on top, resembling a Barracks from the Home Village. In addition to the above features, there is a stone structure on one side with a chimney on top. There is a sword rack visibly seen on the left side of the entrance, signifying the availability to train Raged Barbarians.\n    At level 2, the sword rack is replaced with an archery target on the other side of the Builder Barracks, implying the ability to train Sneaky Archers. The stone structure gains a wooden panel and the chimney is extended.\n    At level 3, the archery target is moved to the left side of the entrance. In its place is a punching bag, implying the ability to train Boxer Giants. The stone structure's wooden panel is replaced by a hinged door, which is seen to be open.\n    At level 4, the punching bag is replaced by a cauldron, probably for the Beta Minions unlocked at this level. In addition to this, the corners and bases of the Builder Barracks are reinforced with stone and metal.\n    At level 5, the cauldron is replaced with a rack full of bombs, implying the ability to train Bombers.\n    At level 6, the rack of bombs is removed and the pair of crossed swords at the top is replaced by a louvered steel vent containing what appears to be lava. This implies that Baby Dragons are able to be trained.\n    At level 7, the vent is replaced by a cannon's barrel, implying the ability to train Cannon Carts at this level.\n    At level 8, the cannon is closed, and the Night Witch's staff can be seen, as well as some Bats, implying the ability to train Night Witches at this level.\n    At level 9, the closed hatch seen on the previous level is replaced by an octagonal platform with a skull, resembling that on the Home Village Witch's staff, underneath it. Rope can be seen on the platform, tethered to the ground. The Night Witch's staff is replaced by a sword rack. The Bats hanging from the left side disappear. These features imply the ability to train Drop Ships at this level.\n    At level 10, the Drop Ship skull and rope has been removed, the archery target absent from the previous level has returned, moved next to the entrance, the roof also gains metal platings nailed down with golden nails. Resting on top of the building is a light blue glowing P.E.K.K.A helmet, which obviously shows the ability to train the Super P.E.K.K.A.\n    At level 11, the blue glowing P.E.K.K.A helmet is removed. Resting on top is a little wood platform connected to ground with a ladder at the left side of the barrack. This structure is presumably for the Hog Glider to climb up the ladder and to the high platform for taking off. The sword rack is replaced by the Hog Rider's hammer, they denote the ability to train the Hog Glider."

The number of troops that each Army Camp can house will depend on the level of that troop.\n    Each Camp trains instantaneously and does not cost any Builder Elixir.\n    You must have all your Army Camps full before you can start a Versus Battle.\n      All the troops in the Army Camps that are trained will be used up even if you do not deploy them, though this is not a significant issue because of the instant training.\n    The build cost and build time for the Army Camp increases the more Army Camps you own. At Builder Hall level 8, you can have a maximum of six Army Camps.\n    Unlike Army Camps in the Home Village, they cannot be upgraded. However, most troops allow more of their kind to fit in a single Army Camp if they are sufficiently upgraded in the Star Laboratory.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n    Army Camps don't have a lot of hitpoints, so place them outside the base or in the corners as a distraction as they do nothing on defense.\n    If you can manage to put it in a defense's range it might kill a couple of Raged Barbarians or Sneaky Archers and catch the opponent off-guard.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n    Try to take out Army Camps with a single small unit, such as a Sneaky Archer or a Beta Minion for extra percentage in the attack."

Upgrades may improve their hitpoints, damage, their special ability, or the number of the same type of troop that is able to fit into one Army Camp.\n      All troops unlock their special abilities at level two, except the Night Witch, whose ability is unlocked at level four. The abilities improve as a troop is upgraded.\n - Upgrade Differences:\n    Each time the Star Laboratory is upgraded (depending on what level) you can see Roman numerals (I-IX) in front that corresponds to the level of the Star Laboratory.\n    The Star Laboratory undergoes significant changes at levels 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.\n      At level 1, the Star Laboratory appears to be an observatory-like building with a small telescope protruding through its top tied with ropes.\n      At level 2, the ladder is moved to the left side of the Star Laboratory with a ramp on the right. The rope is removed from the telescope, and its rim becomes stone.\n      At level 3, the telescope is longer and a ramp replacing the stairs on the left side. The door frames are also partially gold, and the telescope's rim becomes metal.\n      At level 4, the telescope is now golden along with the door frames and the ramp on the right side is replaced by a pressure gauge, similar to those on the Laboratory. The roman numerals also turn gold.\n      At level 5, the telescope becomes rotatable on top of the Star Laboratory using gears. The ramp on the left side turns into metal stairs. The blue gear on the top by the telescope turns golden.\n      At level 6, the telescope's aperture is larger and the type is changed with a refracted focal length, making the overall length shorter.\n      At level 7, a secondary, smaller telescope is added to the right of the primary.\n      At level 8, a tertiary telescope is added next to the secondary on top of the primary. The pressure gauge also turns golden on top.\n      At level 9, the main telescope is reversed to normal length. The needle on the gauge also disappears. A stone also is placed behind the gear."

It is already in the Builder Base when you first enter it, albeit in a broken state. It can be repaired at Builder Hall level 5; doing so will unlock the Battle Machine.\n    Before the Battle Machine is repaired, the Battle Machine Altar is treated similarly to an obstacle (much like the ruined Clan Castle) and cannot be moved around; attacking troops will not be able to attack or destroy it (nor do they need to do so in order to achieve 100% destruction). Once rebuilt, it can be moved freely around.\n    Unlike other hero Altars, this Altar has a seat on top. The seat is painted red with a golden hammer as well as a rim.\n      When inactive, the Battle Machine would sit on its Altar as it is a machine and needs the Master Builder to control it.\n    The Battle Machine does not defend during a battle, unlike the other Heroes in the Home Village.\n    The Altar is considered a regular building in battle, not a defense.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n    The Altar serves no purpose on defense, so it's better to put it outside of the base to distract troops.\n      Even when ruined, your enemies cannot deploy troops on top of the altar, so having your base near it could be beneficial.\n      Try placing it into the corners to let your opponents run out of time.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n    Try to take out the Battle Machine Altar with a single small unit, such as a Sneaky Archer, for extra percentage in the attack."

Rebuilding it is free of charge and takes three seconds to rebuild; however, your Town Hall must be at level 4 or above in order to rebuild it.\n    The Boat allows players to travel between their Home Village and their Builder Base.\n    It is located on the shores of each base.\n    The Builder Boat appears to be a wooden boat with red and white sails on it.\n    The rebuilding process is part of the tutorial of the Builder Base, as is the animation of sailing. A player will be able to instantly travel between bases upon tapping on the Boat after the tutorial.\n - Trivia:\n    The Boat was first seen on the shores of Clash of Clans villages on May 3, 2017. However, the update in which it could be rebuilt was released 19 days later on May 22, 2017.\n    In a tweet about the 2017 May update, Clash of Clans tweeted an image of the Boat.\n      However, the patch was on the left side of the Boat instead of the right like it is now.\n      A tweet on May 11th, 2017 had the patch on the right side of the Boat.\n    The Builder Boat, which is another boat, is located on the left side of the dock in the Builder Base. This Boat allows the Master Builder to travel to your Home Village and gear up your Cannon, Mortar, and Archer Tower in your Home Village, or work in the Home Village as an extra builder once the Master Builder's Hut has been built if you upgraded your O.T.T.O Hut to level 5 once completing all the tasks.\n    Prior to the May 2017 update, the Boat could be seen in the war base floating among the trees.\n    It takes 5 seconds to rebuild - the quickest time to destroy or rebuild something in Clash of Clans, excluding Traps, Walls and heroes which are instant.\n    Even though the description of the Boat has the word places in it, the Boat only takes you to one place, which is the Builder Base.\n    When you look at an Abandoned Base that hasn't logged on to the game since the March 2017 Update, the Boat will not appear."

Once rebuilt, it can be moved freely around.\n    It appears to be a tower with a clock on top in which a hand turns clockwise.\n      The Clock Tower's hand turns very fast when boosting.\n    When activated, the Clock Tower will make timers in the Builder Base speed ten times as fast as normal for a short duration. This duration can be increased by upgrading the Clock Tower.\n      It will speed up resource collectors, construction, upgrades and research timers.\n    The Clock Tower will not reduce the cool-down time of loot from Versus Battles.\n    The Clock Tower will occasionally make a free boost available. Once a free boost has been completely expended, there will be a 22 hour cooldown before the next free boost is available.\n      If the Clock Tower is not active, it can also be activated using Gems. A Clock Tower Potion can also be used to boost the Clock Tower for 30 minutes at any time (this duration is independent of Clock Tower level, and the potion works regardless of whether or not the Clock Tower is active).\n    Upgrading the Clock Tower will disable its ability to boost during the upgrade, however any ongoing boosts will continue for its normal duration.\n - Strategy and Tips:\n    Use the Clock Tower's boost when upgrading or researching something in the Builder Base. However, the Clock Tower will not boost the Master Builder when he is working in your Home Village.\n      Even if the Star Laboratory and Builders are inactive, it can still be useful to boost, as it still speeds up resource production slightly (gaining a few hours' worth of Builder Gold and Elixir).\n    You can also use the Clock Tower's boost when you are trying to remove a lot of obstacles. You can get a lot of gems in no time doing so.\n    The Clock Tower is best placed outside the base as a distraction as it serves little, if any purpose on defense. Its 4x4 space makes it difficult to fit within the Walls. Additionally, due to its larger size, it may be easier to pick off than other buildings if defenses aren't placed properly.\n    The Clock Tower can be used to hide an opening in the Walls which can cause unexpected behavior in certain troops (such as Boxer Giants), and can also be used to funnel troops into Traps. However, experienced players can see through this trick (for instance, by counting the Wall segments) and plan their attack accordingly."

      "title": "Chapter 1: Beginning from the Beginning",
      "content": " When you first start on Clash of Clans, you are given a tutorial. Note that you don't have to spend the Gems it recommends and you do not need an army of Wizards to take out the goblins. After you have completed this tutorial and come to grips with the game, you will face several looming problems.\n You will have a three-day shield that prevents other players from invading your base. This is essential for getting your Defensive Buildings and Resource Buildings to a safe level before you can be attacked.\n The first thing you need to do is upgrade your Elixir Collectors and Gold Mines to a sensibly high level. We recommend at least level 4 at first. This will give you enough of a resource base to keep you going for a while.\n Once you have completed this, you need to see your storages. You have a maximum of two storages of each at first. These resources are elixir and gold, and it is probably best to get both to maximize your resource amounts.\n Don't worry too much about Barracks and Army Camp upgrades at this early stage as they won't protect you from invasion and will only help when you are on the offensive, but do try and get your Town Hall to level three.\n As soon as you have completed these tasks you must turn to your defensive buildings. You will already have a cannon from the tutorial, but apart from that, your first defenses need to be your most important ones, Walls. Use all your walls around your buildings, bearing in mind that the buildings that are most valuable are your storages and your Town Hall. Make sure you can surround your storages and Town Hall completely, but remember that enemies can spawn troops in the corners too - it's not safe to build with no walls in the corner. Surround your base with the less important buildings to slow your attackers and upgrade your walls to at least level 2.\n When you are confident your base is stable, begin the Town Hall level 4 upgrade and start building your cannons and archer towers. Remember not to attack PvP in order to get that gold. Attacking PvP will reduce your shield length by three or more hours each time. Before upgrading to a higher Town Hall level, it may be a good idea to max out mines and collectors as they will be boosted as part of the boosts given when upgrading the Town Hall to a new level. Upgrade your defenses as much as possible and save up to get a mortar as soon as you can. Put the Mortar with your Town Hall and your storages in your walls and keep upgrading them. You want to fit as many of your defensive buildings in your walls as you can whilst keeping your less useful ones outside your base. But remember not to cram all of your defenses in layer of walls. For example, put your Town Hall in its own separate layer of walls. Then put your storages in their own layer of walls. Then pair up, let's say, your archer tower and cannon, and give them their own layer of walls. Keep upgrading your walls and your turrets and you are ready to face the world.",

      "content": " Since your three-day shield is such a blessing, it is not advised that you break it early by going on an attack. Once the time has naturally run out, you are ready to go on the search for trophies and resources.\n Attacking involves three fundamental parts covered in depth here; they will be explored later in terms of applying them at higher levels.\n - Army composition:\n   At later levels, army composition is an essential part of strategy. Based on the type of bases you will encounter at first, we recommend a simple army of only Barbarians at first, as well as any Wizards from from the tutorial, if you still have any. This should help guarantee a win against anyone with badly used walls and poorly placed, exposed mortars.\n   Before you begin your battle, it is a good idea to train excess troops in your Barracks. By the time you have finished raiding, they will most likely be done.\n - Picking the perfect base:\n   At an early level, you can afford to be picky about who you attack. Huge numbers of people begin the game and then quit very quickly (called inactives), so you can look through bases to find the best catch. Ideally, you want a base that you can 3-star for a large number of Trophies to help to lift you up into the trophy levels of more active players.\n   Look for badly deployed or nonexistent walls with an exposed Town Hall and weak defenses. At an early level, also try finding bases with exposed mortars that you can easily wipe. Ultimately you want someone with a good amount of resources and a good amount of trophies up for grabs, in which you can see the stats on the left side when scoping out the bases. Winning a battle like this will set you well on your journey to the top of the leaderboards.\n - Strategy:\n    Strategy is a pretty endless subject - there are countless variations on attack techniques. However, there is one beginner strategy that always works. At the very beginning of the battle, get rid of the mortar first, or else its splash damage will wipe your barbs with ease. Remember that a Mortar has a blind spot where it can't shoot; this spot is a 3-tile radius around it. If your Barbarians manage to enter that blind spot, they're good to go and will take out the mortar without fear of it attacking them. Afterward, simply spam all your remaining Barbarians and they should do a good job wiping out the remainder of the base.When attacking starts to become trickier, feel free to add Archers in the mix.",

      "title": "Chapter 3: Defensive Strategies",
      "content": "Building up a strong defense is just as important as a good attack. Typically when building up your village, you don't want to upgrade your Town Hall too fast without upgrading your surrounding defenses and resources first. Upgrade everything equally, because a high-leveled Town Hall won't help anything if you have low leveled Defensive Buildings or Resource Buildings.\n - Defensive Buildings:\n    Upgrade your Town Hall enough to let you continue upgrading your buildings. As said above, don't over-upgrade your Town Hall, or your gold will be wasted when it could have been spent on upgrading defenses. Carefully watch any replays of people attacking you and see if you won or lost. If you won, your defenses are doing their job. If you lost, think about where you could put your defensive buildings in a better spot. Typically, people put their Mortars in the center of their base because of its blind spot and long range. We will explain more about base design in the next chapter but think carefully about how to better your base.\n    Once you get your first few defense results, keep upgrading your defenses. There are many different opinions on which ones to upgrade first, so choose which ones you think would fit your base.\n - Clan Castle Troops:\n    If you are in a clan, the rest of your clanmates can donate troops to you. These troops will defend your base if you are attacked. Remember that a clan castle filled with Archers can deal a lot more damage than your turrets, but the archers are very easy to kill. Troops with preferred targets will target their preferred targets over any clan castle troops. This is important when dealing with giant rushes! A Giant will continue to attack a turret even when there are clan castle troops behind it shooting. This can make clan castle troops a key part of a good defensive setup.",

Anyways, onto the actual base design. First, you should figure out if you are farming or hunting trophies.\n - Farming:\n    If you're farming (not recommended until you've got the hang of the game) then put your resource storages closer to the center than your Town Hall. Make sure to place your storages at the very center of your base while defenses surround them. By doing this, the enemies will have a very hard time getting to your resources.\n    Old guides suggest putting the Town Hall outside, however, this is not a good idea in modern Clash of Clans. If the Town Hall is outside and unprotected, people who are looking for trophies will attack that Town Hall and end the battle. This is a problem as the Town Hall houses a large number of resources which is stolen when the building is destroyed. In addition, a shield is not obtained by simply destroying a Town Hall, which will leave you vulnerable to others attacking you after the 30 minute guard you earned ends. For you to get a shield attackers need to get 30% and they need to have deployed 1/3rd of the maximum army space available to the defenders Town Hall.\n - Trophy Hunting::\n    If you're trophy hunting, then protect your Town Hall at all costs by putting it in the center, placing defenses around it, making sure you have extra walls around it, etc. Also make sure that you don't have 50% of your buildings outside of walls, because your opponents can pick off those buildings (with archers) and get one star by doing so, costing you trophies. You also want to protect your Resource Buildings, but depending on how determined you are to keep trophies rather than resources, some players make sure their defenses are still safe and able to defend the Town Hall and therefore leaving the resources unprotected.\n    In a nutshell, position the structures you want to protect most (usually gold/elixir/dark elixir storages, or the town hall) in the middle, within firing range of all your defenses.\n    You should place Gold Mines and Elixir Collectors outside of this. Dark Elixir Drills are for Dark Elixir; raiders can steal 75% of your collected Dark Elixir from the drill itself. However, only 4-6% can be stolen from the storage, so put the drills inside your walls. If you are reading this, you most likely won't have the Dark Elixir unlocked quite yet, so you shouldn't need to worry yet. By positioning the mines and collectors on the outside like this, your defenses can focus on defending your most important buildings. They will still attack enemy units within range.\n    Follow these with miscellaneous buildings that won't give resources but act as buffers to your resources (ex. Builder's Hut, Laboratory, etc.). This lets long range defensive structures like Mortars and Archer Towers deal some extra damage to troops.\n    The next chapter explains more about the offensive side of farming and trophy hunting.",

      "title": "Chapter 5: Farming",
      "content": " Pick and choose your targets. You're farming, not trophy hunting. You're looking for targets with lots of available resources and weak defenses against your army. When farming, look for bases that have most if not all of its resources in their collectors and mines (not in their storages). If the resources are in the collectors and mines, you can drop a few goblins and archers on each building and take all the resources. Note: When you are farming, you will usually lose trophies quickly due to some defensive and offensive losses.\n For less experienced players, we would recommend a simple army of Goblins, up to your max if your army camps store less than 30. If your army camps store at least 50, it is a good idea to compose your army with 30-35 Goblins, at least 2 Giants, and the rest Archers.\n If you have a capacity of at least 100 in your Army Camps, we would recommend the simple Goblin army, or 60-70 Goblins, several Giants as meatshields, and the rest archers for picking off buildings at a distance.\n If you have a capacity of at least 150 in your camps, we would recommend 80-90 Goblins, around 5 Giants, and the rest Archers.\n If you have 200 Army Camp spaces, then try 100 Goblins, 10 Giants as meatshields, a few Wall Breakers and the rest Archers.\n An old tactic to farming was to place the Town Hall outside of your base undefended, as it used to give a shield when destroyed, however this no longer works as they no longer grant a shield upon destruction, and the Town Hall will hold loot that can be stolen.",

You may find a few bases will Town Halls outside because they're old farming bases or are trying to drop trophies. When you find these exposed town halls (usually in corners) drop around 3 archers and they will destroy the town hall, unless it has a giga weapon..\n When you're looking for bases as a trophy hunter, make sure you attack bases that you know you can destroy. Using that extra gold and extra time will benefit your trophy count in the long run.",

      "title": "Chapter 7: Balancing your Base",
      "content": " You should usually try to max out everything for your Town Hall level so that you get the best advantage when you upgrade the Town Hall.\n When upgrading your buildings, try not to prioritize defensive buildings over resource and army buildings. Try having one builder upgrading one building in each category. This will make sure you have a well-rounded base with a good army; not a base with maxed defense and a level 2 barracks.\n You should always try to be upgrading something in the Laboratory as it does not require a builder to do so.\n Always upgrade your buildings in the least time-consuming way, so try to keep all your cannons around the same level (ex. some 5, some 6) instead of having them spread apart (ex. one 10, the rest 2). Also, try and upgrade the time-consuming buildings while you go to bed so in the morning the upgrade will be finished or almost finished. Keep the short upgrades that take only a few hours for during the daytime while you're actually playing.\n Also, not all defensive structures are the same. It is important to have a centralized Clan Castle and a Mortar triangle in the center, all covered by walls. Keep another defensive building nearby to protect the mortars, as the mortars have a dead zone surrounding them where they will not target enemy troops. Mortars also do not target air units so the defense that you use to cover the mortar should be able to target air units as well. Mortars do huge splash damage to your enemies and will also destroy tonnes of enemies while the enemy is destroying other buildings. As you gain more trophies, you will also find defenses with Wizard Towers, which can be even more dangerous due to its higher attack rate.\n Remember: Having a powerful army is very important because you have a better chance of destroying the enemy's defenses and stealing all their loot.",

      "content": " Raiding is what Clash of Clans is centered around. There are hundreds and thousands of strategies out there created by different players, so pick one that fits your style. Are you more of a conservative player and like to play the game out or do you love to watch Hog Riders cruise through the base like they don't even care what's shooting at them? Find your style.\n There are plenty of attack strategies on the wiki. Search around to find what fits you, or create your own style. Watching YouTube videos of attacks is very helpful to see how the player is placing the troops. If you are more of a conservative player, you might like using Giants as a tanking unit, and putting units like Wall Breakers and Archers behind him. If you like fast-paced gameplay, you might like using Hog Riders with a Rage Spell.",

      "title": "Chapter 9: Builder Base",
      "content": " At Town Hall level 4, you can repair the boat on the coastline which brings you to a new location called the Builder Base. This is similar to the regular village, but instead of regular raids, there are Versus Battles where two players attack each other's bases to try to get the most stars in order to win.\n The versus battle mode is not the only difference from the main village. You can only select one troop type per Army Camp in the Builder Base. Troops can be generated and switched instantaneously in the Builder Barracks or when planning an attack. Walls come in lines of five segments. You start out with only one builder in the Builder Base.\n Generally, as it is only possible to gain resources from versus battles up to 3 times in a 22 hour period, passive resource collection is more important to upgrade and max out. As a bonus, the Gem Mine can be repaired in the Builder Base, which produces 2 to 4.8 gems per day depending on its upgrade level.\n For end-game purposes, it is a good idea to keep up with the Builder Base progress, as when you reach Town Hall level 10 and Builder Hall level 9, the O.T.T.O Hut can be fully built after completing 4 objectives, which allows you to have a second builder in the Builder Base, or have an additional builder in the home village. Only one of these can be done at a time, though you can switch between them when O.T.T.O is not working on a building.\n Best of luck to your Clash of Clans career! Clash on!",

They are also the cheapest and one of the most common defensive structure available, which makes them a good initial investment.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Cannons are one of the few defensive structures that cannot attack air units. This makes them easy pickings for Beta Minions or Baby Dragons if they are not within range of Firecrackers, Archer Towers, Hidden Teslas, or Air Bombs.\n   The Beta Minions' Long Shot ability allows them to destroy a Cannon while out of range if there are enough and placed correctly.\n   Cannons are only able to damage one unit at a time.

This requires Cannon at least level 7 in the Home Village and a level 4 Double Cannon in the Builder Base.\n   While Double Cannons do high damage per second, they have a short range and cannot attack air troops.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   Double Cannons can destroy most ground troops of relative level in one burst, namely Raged Barbarians, Sneaky Archers, Bombers, Cannon Carts and Night Witches. This makes Double Cannons useful to pick off smaller troops when they are in small numbers.\n   Double Cannons are very powerful defenses against ground tanks such as the Boxer Giant or the Battle Machine. A few volleys can do significant damage to them.\n   Their short range prevents them from protecting buildings in front of them from Sneaky Archers if a Wall separates the Double Cannon and the building. It may still be useful to leave a building in front of them to prevent Sneaky Archers from easily destroying them under their cloak.\n   Although it has high damage output, the Double Cannon has a weakness against large swarms, as their burst only targets one unit. You will find it useful to protect Double Cannons with splash-damaging defenses like the Multi Mortar or the Roaster. Its inability to attack air also means that you should also protect Double Cannons with air-targeting defenses like Archer Towers.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Air troops such as the Baby Dragon have little to worry from a Double Cannon since the Double Cannon cannot attack them. However, the Double Cannon can still distract them and prevent them from attacking more important buildings.\n   The Double Cannon is weak against large swarms.

      "desc": "- Summary:\n   The Archer Tower is a defensive building that can target both air and ground units. This building is unlocked at Builder Hall level 2. Like the Home Village Archer Tower, it is a single-target defense.\n   The Archer Tower can be set to Long Range or Fast Attack. Both modes has its advantages and disadvantages.\n     The Long Range mode gives the Archer Tower a range of eleven tiles, at the cost of DPS. It has the lowest DPS of any single-target defensive building at relative level in this mode.\n     The Fast Attack mode gives the Archer Tower additional damage output by firing twice as fast as the Long Range mode. This comes at the cost of range - even as its range is reduced by four tiles, it covers only about 40% of the area that a Long Range Archer Tower would cover.\n     When upgrading, an Archer Tower's damage per second increase of Fast Attack is twice as much as the damage per second increase of Long Range so Fast Attack is always twice the DPS of Long Range.\n   The Master Builder can go to your Home Village and gear up an Archer Tower that is level 10 or above in order to allow it to toggle between Long Range and Fast Attack modes. This requires a level 6 Archer Tower in the Builder Base. Like with other gear ups, only one Archer Tower can be geared up.\n   The Archer Tower in fast fire mode in the Builder Base has the same attack speed as a normal Archer Tower in the Home Village.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   An Archer Tower set to Long Range can protect outer buildings from Sneaky Archers and Beta Minions. However, the Sneaky Archer's Cloak ability allows it to hide for a few seconds, and the Archer Tower can do nothing to stop the Sneaky Archers under their cloak.\n   An Archer Tower that is set to Fast Attack cannot protect buildings in front of it. However, it is more effective at taking down tank-units, and they are more able to handle small swarms of Bats or Skeletons in this manner.\n   You can protect Archer Towers with splash damaging defenses like the Crusher since it is a single-target defense.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Try to swarm the Archer Tower with swarm units such as Raged Barbarians as it is single-target.\n   Use tanks like Boxer Giants to distract it so that supported troops can take down outer buildings.\n   Long-range Archer Towers have fairly low damage output, taking three shots to kill equivalently-leveled Sneaky Archers or Beta Minions. If you use Sneaky Archers or Beta Minions to snipe buildings and there are no more unprotected buildings, choosing buildings protected only by a single long-range Archer Tower will give your troops the most time to attack before they are destroyed.",

It is unlocked at Builder Hall level 3.\n   Before it begins attacking, the Hidden Tesla remains completely hidden to the attacker. Once a unit is within 6 tiles of the Tesla, the Tesla emerges from the ground and begins attacking. Like its Home Village counterpart, it automatically emerges from the ground if it's still hidden when at least 51% of the base is destroyed.\n   It attacks enemies with electricity, just like its Home Village counterpart. It has the same fire rate and range, however, its damage compared to equivalently leveled Hidden Teslas in the Home Village is higher at low levels but lower at high levels.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Enemies need a 2x2 clear space for a Hidden Tesla, evaluate the worst place for a Tesla placement and deploy accordingly.\n   Sneaky Archers can show you the location of a Hidden Tesla, even when invisible. Placing one Sneaky Archer of the relative level or will be able to take down the Hidden Tesla.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   The Hidden Tesla can be used to lure your opponent into an air attack, then take out the air units. This is very effective at Builder Hall level three as they only have Beta Minions; when your opponent destroys your Firecrackers and Archer Tower, he/she will send in his/her Beta Minions only to get destroyed by your Hidden Tesla.\n   You can place a Hidden Tesla at the corner of a base (far away from everything else on the base) as a tactic to stall enemy attacks. If the enemy deploys their full army before achieving 51% (or otherwise revealing the Tesla), they will not have anything to immediately deal with the corner Tesla, which can stall out their attack should they destroy all other buildings on the base. Provided that you are able to 3-star their base, this can potentially allow you to achieve victory on the time tiebreaker.",

The Air Bombs do high, area damage in a small range while the Firecrackers snipe away at long range.\n   At Builder Hall level 3, Firecrackers are an essential defense against Beta Minions as the Archer Tower and Hidden Tesla can both be distracted by ground units.",

Troops prefer to target buildings over Walls so they will run through the gap.\n   You can put a Guard Post near a Crusher so the Guard Post troops will lure your opponent's troops into the Crusher.\n   Protect short-ranged defenses such as the Double Cannon and the Mega Tesla behind the Crusher as ground troops will have to go through the Crusher to destroy it.\n   Try to avoid putting Crushers by Walls as they cannot crush troops over them, allowing the ranged units more time to destroy the Crusher.\n   Try to put Crushers near your Firecrackers and Air Bombs to protect them from the Skeletons of the Drop Ship. Since they tend to have a tough time taking the Crusher out, it will stall the Drop Ships, giving your Firecrackers and Air Bombs ample time to take it out.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   The Boxer Giant's Power Punch ability can destroy a Crusher if there are enough Giants at once.\n   Use air troops to take down the Crusher if using a swarm attack. This is only for unprotected Crushers - watch out for Firecrackers, Air Bombs, and the Archer from the Guard Post!\n   To avoid a luring technique, as explained above, use Bombers to destroy Walls and create another opening into a base away from the Crusher.\n   The Battle Machine can take out the Crusher before it does massive damage to units, especially with the ability, Electric Hammer. However, with the help of other defenses, the Battle Machine will likely be at low hitpoints or taken out by the Crusher.\n   You can take advantage of the Crusher's long cooldown time between slams by baiting it with a few Raged Barbarians then swarming it with more Raged Barbarians to take it down before it has a chance to crush the rest of the Raged Barbarians again.

Extra Raged Barbarians or Sneaky Archers may be added with a new level.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Troops that don't have a preferred target will turn to target Guard Post troops even while attacking another building.\n   You can use air units such as Baby Dragons to take out the Raged Barbarian(s) from the Guard Post as they can't target air.\n   The Bomber's splash damage allows them to destroy any Guard Post troops with a few shots along with other buildings and Walls.\n     Their ability, which allows them to do extra damage on the first throw, allows them to one-shot the troops.\n   When using Sneaky Archers, make sure you destroy the Guard Post troops or attack from far off as the Sneaky Archers will not distract the Guard Post troops and follow them instead while they are still in their cloaks.\n     Raged Barbarians are excellent at finishing off Guard Post troops as they are expendable units that are fast and can attract Guard Post troops.\n   Beta Minions can kill off Guard Post troops well given their Long Shot ability, which protects them from both defences and the Guard Post troops for a short while.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   The Guard Post can be placed near defensive buildings to distract enemies, giving defenses more time for damage. They can also snipe away at building-targeting troops like the Boxer Giant.\n   The Guard Post can protect outer buildings that are out of range of other defensive buildings.\n   You can use the Guard Post to tank the Power Punch of the Boxer Giant(s) as the building itself serves no purpose on defense.\n   Since most troops will attack the Guard Post troops if attacked by them, you can strategically use the Guard Post troops to lure them into the range of powerful defenses like the Crusher.",

To do so, the Multi Mortar needs to be level 8 in the Builder Base.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   Place the Multi Mortar at the center of the base to cover as much area as possible and to slow troops from getting too close to it.\n     You can use the Multi Mortar's inability to hit nearby units to your advantage, as the Multi Mortar will target support units, such as the Sneaky Archers, Cannon Carts, and Night Witches following behind the tanks and take care of them so they don't do too much damage.\n   The Multi Mortar's splash damaging shells makes it good at taking down hordes of low-hitpoint troops but can be easily distracted by high-hitpoint troops. In particular, they work very well against Sneaky Archers and Skeletons dropped by the Drop Ship, but can also deal good damage to Raged Barbarians, Night Witches and Cannon Carts.\n   Because of its inability to hit nearby troops, it can be good to place the Crusher near it as it is another area damage defense that deals high damage. However, the Crusher cannot fully cover the blind spot of the Multi Mortar due to its extremely short range. In addition, neither can attack air troops, so that should also be kept in mind when building a layout.\n   The Multi Mortar can stop Bombers from doing too much damage to your base. At relative level, where the Bomber is twice or less than the level of the Multi Mortar, a volley of 4 shots can destroy a Bomber.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Air units are a good option, as the Multi Mortar cannot hit them.\n     Drop Ships cannot be attacked by the Multi Mortar, but its Skeletons can be easily wiped out by it, unless they get too close.\n     Use tanks such as Boxer Giants or the Battle Machine to distract the Multi Mortar while you swarm the base. Take care that they do not all enter the Multi Mortar's blind spot, otherwise, it will retarget.\n   Try to get near it as it cannot hit troops close to it.\n   Try to spread out your troops so the Multi Mortar cannot hit all of them at once.",

Note that placing both on top of each other will cause the fire's splash damage to hit both.\n   Scattering troops prevents the Roaster from hitting all of them at once.",

The cannonball slows down the further it travels.\n   It has a low fire rate but deals moderate damage per hit.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   The Giant Cannon has a lock-on range of 9 tiles but the fired projectile can travel 48 tiles.\n   You can put a Giant Cannon behind other buildings to assist their defense - it can hit all ground units in a row. This is especially true for strategies which utilize Raged Barbarians where a player attempts swarms their army into the center of the base.\n   Putting this near the Builder Hall makes Troops uses longer time to attack it due to the repel distance.\n   The Giant Cannon can deal damage to both a tank and their support troops as long as they are lined up.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Try to spread out your troops so they are not in line with the Giant Cannon; otherwise, the Giant Cannon will be able to hit all of them at once.\n   Use the slow fire rate to your advantage by baiting it to shoot a few troops then swarming it with other troops before it can shoot again. Only use this if you don't have tanks to take it out and if the Giant Cannon is not guarded by a Crusher.\n   The Boxer Giant and Battle Machine are good tanks against a Giant Cannon.

      "desc": "- Summary:\n   The Mega Tesla is a defensive building in the Builder Base that unlocks at Builder Hall level 8.\n   It is a defense that can damage both air and ground troops.\n   The Mega Tesla attacks with chain lightning; the electricity it fires damages a first target within the range of the Tesla, and then, if possible, the bolt will arc towards a second target up to 3 tiles away from the first target and hit for full damage.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   The Mega Tesla deals high damage, but has a low fire rate and can only hit up to two targets per attack. It is therefore most specialised at attacking troops that are relatively low in numbers, such as Baby Dragons, Cannon Carts and Hog Gliders, while troops that have strength in numbers or can swarm the Mega Tesla with its spawns, such as Raged Barbarians or Night Witches, will have less trouble with the Mega Tesla.\n   Because of the aforementioned weakness against swarms, it is good to protect the Mega Tesla using splash-damaging defenses and traps, such as the Roaster, Crusher, and Mega Mines, to prevent enemies from distracting it with lower-hitpoint troops.\n   Among defenses of equal level, the Mega Tesla does the second-most damage of any defense in the Builder Base, behind the Crusher. However, the Mega Tesla has advantages over the Crusher in that it can target air troops (and ranged troops in most scenarios) at the cost of AOE, where Crusher has an advantage.\n   The Mega Tesla's Chain Lightning is able to target hidden Sneaky Archers but only if it somehow attacks an enemy that is too close to the archer.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Mega Tesla is extremely weak against swarms, so Raged Barbarians can have an advantage since they would only be able to take out two at a time.\n   Drop Ships can tank several shots from the Mega Tesla and drop Skeletons to distract it and potentially deal damage (though minor).",

      "name": "Lava Launcher",
      "desc": "- Summary:\n   The Lava Launcher is a defensive building that is unlocked at Builder Hall level 9.\n   It throws powerful balls of lava that do a small amount of damage on impact, but leaves the ground scorched, which has a damage-over-time effect (similar to the Poison Spell) on ground troops. The effect of the lava remains for 20 seconds after impact.\n   It has a very large range, but also a very large blind spot as well.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Using air troops is advantageous, as the Lava Launcher cannot attack air units. For this purpose, Baby Dragons or Drop Ships paired with Beta Minions work very well, though in the case of Drop Ships, their Skeletons' effect may be nullified by the Lava Launcher.\n   If your only option of attacking is by ground then the best way to proceed would be to distract the Lava Launcher with expendable units such as a single Raged Barbarian, and ensure it fires away from the line of attack until the main attacking force has safely entered the Lava Launcher's blind spot. If done correctly the lava will not impede the attack's progress.\n   Super P.E.K.K.As are also useful as their very high health means that they can survive for much longer in the lava compared to other troops.\n   The Battle Machine is largely immune to the damage over time effect (like how Heroes are minimally affected by Poison Spells), so having the Battle Machine be targeted will minimize the DPS of the Lava Launcher.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   Often it is not the damage of the lava shot itself that is devastating, but rather the massive DPS from the damage over time effect of the resulting lava. If allowed to reach maximum DPS the lava can easily make short work of many smaller troops, such as Raged Barbarians, Sneaky Archers, Cannon Carts, and Night Witches. To increase the chances of this happening it is often advantageous to stall attacking troops behind Walls so that they will stay in the lava for as long as possible, racking up damage, but make sure that the Walls can cover the Lava Launcher's blind spot.\n     It is also useful to protect these Walls as Bombers can easily clear them, allowing for other troops to rush into the blind spot.\n   The biggest weakness of the Lava Launcher is its blind spot. Cover it with other defenses to protect it and try to use traps to keep troops in the range of the Launcher.",

These segments cannot be separated but can be rotated. When upgraded, all the Walls in the same segment will be upgraded at the same time.\n     This is true when counting Walls. When you unlock new Walls, it may say that you unlocked 25 Walls, but there are only 5 more wall segments.\n - Offensive Strategy:\n   Walls can be circumvented by destroying them or positioning ranged troops to shoot over the Walls. Walls can be bypassed completely by air units such as Beta Minions.\n     Melee units will only attack Walls if there are no other buildings near them and if there is a building on the other side of the Wall.\n     Ranged units will only attack Walls if there are no other buildings in their sight ranges other than those across the Wall that is (almost) completely surrounded by Walls and that are outside its attack range.\n   The Bomber has a 15x damage multiplier against walls.\n - Defensive Strategy:\n   Purposely create gaps in Walls to put a trap in as the enemy troops will walk into the gap instead of breaking the Wall.\n     You can also do this by putting a Crusher in the gap.\n   Use Walls to surround defenses to protect them. Try to surround structures that assist in defense so they do not get taken out easily.\n   It is unnecessary to protect resource buildings with Walls since they are used to absorb damage, and it is not possible to lose resources from versus battles. Protecting them, however, can still force the opponent to break through them and stall their progress.\n   Do not place 3x3 buildings too close to the Walls. If a Bomber is protected and manages to target it, the Walls will be shattered easily. This is especially dangerous if the Bomber is at level 11 since its ability can destroy Walls at any level.",

They can greatly improve the effectiveness of a village's defense if properly placed.\n   Traps do not light up the map like other buildings.\n   Traps are always ready for the next battle and do not need to be re-armed, unlike the ones in the Home Village.\n   Although commonly thought of as a trap, the Hidden Tesla is not listed here as it actually a hidden Defensive Building.\n   Traps are not buildings and do not need to be triggered/destroyed for your enemy to reach 100% destruction (nor do they count toward it).\n   Traps do not need the Master Builder to be available in order to be placed, however, the Master Builder needs to be available to upgrade them.\n   Traps are best used to push enemies off the base or just push them, or just to reduce the enemies health.\n   The Mine and Mega Mine can be set to hit ground or air troops.\n - Upgrade Facts:\n   Currently, all permanent traps have upgrade levels.\n   You can upgrade a trap once it is bought from the Shop. Buying the trap does not require the Master Builder; however, upgrading will.\n   Upgrade times are relatively short compared to defensive building upgrades, taking less time than defensive buildings of similar level.\n   Upgrade times are relatively short compared to defensive building upgrades, taking less time than defensive buildings of similar level.\n   Traps have different upgrade types, with some traps increasing their affected housing space like the Push Trap while others dealing more damage, like the Mine.\n   Traps being upgraded are visible to enemies; it is usually a good idea to relocate them while they are being upgraded to ensure that enemies don't know where traps aren't. However, remember to replace them when it is finished upgrading.\n   Each trap must be upgraded individually. Upgrading one trap does not upgrade all traps of that type.\n   Traps have no effect on the no-spawn zone. Attackers can deploy troops on top of traps regardless of whether or not they are being upgraded.\n - Using Traps:\n   Traps in the Builder Base do not require re-arming, unlike those in the Home Village. They will remain armed for the next battle.\n   Once a particular trap is upgraded, it is permanently upgraded. Upgrade levels don't disappear when it is triggered.",

One surefire way of exiting early is by misjudging your initial landing spot, which is why it’s first on our list of PUBG Mobile tips and tricks. \n As a general rule of thumb, you want to aim for the best loot spots in the game map you’re playing on, while also avoiding as many other players as possible. There are some particular areas that regularly spawn the best weapons and armor such as the military base, power plant, or the various major towns in the original map Erangel, but bare in mind that other seasoned players will be heading there too.Once you’ve jumped out of the cargo plane, keep an eye out for swarms of other players heading to a single location and avoid those areas like the plague. Likewise, don’t just aimlessly drift once you’re in freefall—pinpoint a safe enough area, preferably with buildings so you can grab some loot, and push forward to speed your way there. Buildings will show up as white blocks on the mini map, so make sure you’re heading in the right direction. If you can’t see one you can always open your parachute early and coast over to a decent landing zone. Just be aware that every second you spend in the sky is a second your opponents will be using to scoop up loot.",
